# ü©∫ PCOS Detection using Deep Learning

This project focuses on the automated detection of **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)** using deep learning techniques. It leverages medical imaging data and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images as indicative of PCOS or not, providing an assistive tool for early diagnosis.

## üìå Problem Statement

PCOS is a common hormonal disorder affecting women of reproductive age. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial but can be challenging due to overlapping symptoms. This project aims to build a reliable classification model using ultrasound images to assist healthcare professionals in the diagnostic process.

## üß† Approach

- **Data Collection**: A dataset of labeled ovarian ultrasound images was used. Images are categorized into PCOS and non-PCOS classes.
- **Preprocessing**: 
  - Image resizing and normalization
  - Data augmentation to prevent overfitting
- **Model Architecture**:
  - CNN-based model built using TensorFlow/Keras
  - Experimented with architectures like VGG16, ResNet50 for better accuracy
- **Training**:
  - Train/Validation/Test split
  - Used techniques like dropout, batch normalization
- **Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion matrix and ROC curve
